# About

The POMO Plugin is a simple Pomodoro Timer application designed to help users manage their time effectively. The default time selections are backed by decades of research by the Pomodoro Technique Foundation developed by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s and has been a staple of time management since then.

We understand that not everyone conforms or prefers to work on these timelines, so we gave you the ability to change your default times. An added bonus is a small task or note section that you can use to quickly outline what you want to get done before or after your POMO session.

Feel free to minimize POMO as you work, when your timer is up, a tune will play letting you know its time to take a break, or get back to work. We plan to offer many more of these short songs in the future so that you can customize your experience even further.

### Key Features

- Pomodoro Timer - Stay productive with a 25 minute work timer (Default)
- Take Breaks - Chose between short 5 minute breaks or long 15 minute breaks.(Default)
- Fits Your Needs - Adjust the Pomodoro time and your break times as you see fit!

## Installation

POMO is available through the SimpleToolSuite plugin manager and does not have to be downloaded seperatly. If for some reason it is not available through the built in Plugin Manager, follow these steps

1. Download POMO
2. Open SimpleToolSuite and navigate to the settings tab.
3. Under Plugin Location, select the "Open" button.
4. Drag and drop your STS-PLUGIN-POMO folder into your plugin folder.
5. Navigate back to the plugins tab and click "Load Plugin"
6. Select POMO and click launch.

If POMO does not show in your plugins list after you click Load Plugins, verify that your plugin folder structure is correct. Your folder structure should be: `SimpleToolSuite/Plugins/STS-PLUGIN-POMO/`

If you run into any problems throughout the process feel free to scroll back up to the top, and either join our discord to ask questions, or report a bug!
